    sites in the world, it is Located 240 km south of the capital Amman and 120 km north of the
     red sea town of Aqaba (see the Map), Petra the world wonder, is undoubtedly Jordan's most 
     valuable treasure and greatest tourist attraction, and it is visited by tourists from all over 
     the world. It is not known precisely when Petra was built, but the city began to prosper as the

       myrrh, and spices.

   <b style="font-weight:bold;"> Petra was later </b> Petra was later annexed to the Roman Empire and continued to thrive until a large earthquake in 363 AD destroyed much of the city in the 4th century AD. The earthquake combined with changes in trade 
     routes, eventually led to the downfall of the city which was ultimately abandoned.By the middle 
     of the 7th century Petra appears to have been largely deserted and it was then lost to all except 
     local Bedouin from the area. In 1812 a Swiss explorer named Johannes Burckhardt set out to rediscover
     Petra; he dressed up as an Arab and convinced his Bedouin guide to take him to the lost city, After this, 
     Petra became increasingly known in the West as a fascinating and beautiful ancient city, and it began 
     attracting visitors and  continues to do so today.

You will then come across the Obelisk Tomb, which was carved by the Nabataeans in the 1st century AD. Above the tomb are four pyramids nafes as well as a niche with a statue in bas-relief that is a symbolic representation of the five people buried there. Below it is the Triclinium, which was a banqueting hall. In the opposing cliff face there is a double inscription in Nabataean and Greek that refers to a burial monument.Excavations have demonstrated that it was the ability of the Nabataeans to control the water.
